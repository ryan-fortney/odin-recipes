    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today we’re pairing these Churros with a Vegan Salted Caramel dipping sauce because when I was visualizing what I wanted to do with the churros, I could not stop smelling cajeta.</p>
        <p>I kept picturing myself walking around El Jardín de la Villa being enveloped by the aroma of tacos de adobada, hot cakes with cajeta sizzling over a hot skillet, and the smell of dough being deep fried and being tossed around in sweet sugar and cinnamon.</p>

            <br>
            <li>Transfer your dough into a large piping bag with a large star tip on it and place it in the fridge to cool for an extra 30 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large pot, bring the rest of the vegetable oil to 350 degrees (adjust the amount of oil depending on the size of your pot), using a thermometer. Adjust the heat to keep the oil at a constant temperature during frying</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pipe 4 inch long churros into the oil very carefully, and fry for about 4-5 minutes until they are crispy and golden brown.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the churros from the oil and let them drain on paper towels.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine the remaining two tablespoons of sugar with the cinnamon in a large bowl. Toss the churros around the bow to coat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve with a side of the dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Refrigerate the can of coconut milk for at least a couple hours to firm up the cream and help it separate from the water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once it’s firmed up scoop out 1 cup of the cream* and add it to a medium sized saucepan with the brown sugar and salt and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking occasionally, then boil for 5 minutes still whisking occasionally to make sure nothing burns. Turn off the heat, whisk in the vanilla, and let the sauce cool before serving.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li><em>*All cans of coconut milk are different so you might not get a full cup but that’s cool, just adjust the brown sugar to match whatever amount you get</em></li>
        </ul>
